// Package v1alpha1 defines the Kubernetes-style API types for all agentregistry
// resources.
//
// Every resource — Agent, MCPServer, Skill, Prompt, Deployment, Provider —
// uses the same envelope: apiVersion + kind + metadata + spec + status.
// These types are the single wire/storage/API contract propagating from a YAML
// manifest through the HTTP handler, Go client, service layer, and database
// row (spec+status as JSONB; metadata columns promoted). No intermediate DTOs,
// no translation functions.
//
// Typed objects (Agent, MCPServer, etc.) are the preferred handle. RawObject
// is the un-typed wire envelope used during apply dispatch when the kind is
// not yet known; use Scheme.Decode / Scheme.DecodeMulti to route into a typed
// object by kind.

// plural doesn't match this default should expose their own
